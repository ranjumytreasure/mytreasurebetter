## 🧮 **Business Logic Implemented**

### **1. Loan Disbursement:**
```
Input: ₹10,000, 100 Days Daily (2% interest)
    ↓
Calculations:
- Interest = 10,000 × 2% = ₹200
- Cash in Hand = 10,000 - 200 = ₹9,800
- Per Day Due = 10,000 / 100 = ₹100
    ↓
Create:
- 1 loan record
- 100 receivable records
    ↓
Done in single transaction!
```

### **2. Day Exclusion:**
```
Exclude: Sundays
Duration: 100 cycles
Start Due: 2025-10-16 (Thursday)
    ↓
Generated:
Day 1: 2025-10-16 (Thu) ✅

Day 4: 2025-10-20 (Mon) ✅
...
Total: 100 cycles (Sundays excluded)
```

  Paid: (future)
  Carry Forward: (future)
  Closing: ₹9,900
